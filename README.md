# Roman Varum - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Roman! I'm an aspiring data analyst passionate about tech, languages, and dataviz, currently seeking a junior or entry-level analytics role. A political and investigative reporter in the past with a knack for finding patterns and artifacts buried in numbers. In love with science fiction, blues music, and sports. 

Below is a collection of my practice projects. I've uploaded them as they are, complete with feedback and the reviews I got from professional data analysts who've pointed out occasional mistakes, suggested improvements or complemented the work done.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will briefly describe each of the projects and what kind of problems I solved completing them.

### Data Cleaning: Analysing Borrowers' Risk of Default
**Code:** [`p1_data_cleaning_Borrowers_Risk_of_Defaulting.ipynb`](https://github.com/vrova3/data_analysis_practice_projects/blob/main/p1_data_cleaning_Borrowers_Risk_of_Defaulting.ipynb)    
**Description:** The dataset contains 21525 records pertaining to individual borrowers with 12 fields to describe them such as the number of days employed, number of children, family status, level of education, income type and others. The project is centered around data cleaning and preprocessing, including fairly tricky cases of dealing with missing, duplicate, and incorrectly converted data.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis: Car Sales Ads Research
**Code:** [`p2_EDA_Car_Sales_Ads.ipynb`](https://github.com/vrova3/data_analysis_practice_projects/blob/main/p2_EDA_Car_Sales_Ads.ipynb)
**Description:** The dataset has 51525 entries for individual car sale ads posted on a classified ads website and contains 13 fields describing the car characteristics and the duration of the ad.
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualisation.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotlib.

### Statistical Analysis: Comparing Mobile Plans
**Code:** [`p3_statistical_analysis_Megaline_Mobile_Plans.ipynb`](https://github.com/vrova3/data_analysis_practice_projects/blob/main/p3_statistical_analysis_Megaline_Mobile_Plans.ipynb)
**Description:** The data for this project is scattered across 5 datasets: data on web sessions, calls, messages, and users, and a table describing the different plans.
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualisation, hypothesis testing (t-testing) .
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy Stats, MatPlotlib, SeaBorn.

### Integrated Project 1: Video Game Sales Research
**Code:** [`p4_integrated_project_1_Video_Game_Sales.ipynb`](https://github.com/vrova3/data_analysis_practice_projects/blob/main/p4_integrated_project_1_Video_Game_Sales.ipynb)
**Description:** The dataset contains 16715 entries, where each is a record for a video game, with fields describing its title, genre, year of release, platform, critic and user scores, and sales figures for North America, the EU, Japan and the rest of the other markets.
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualisation, hypothesis testing (t-testing), statistical testing.
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy Stats, MatPlotlib, SeaBorn.

### Business Analytics: Calculating LTV, CAC, ROI for Online Afisha App
**Code:** [`p5_business_analytics_LTV_CAC_ROI_for_Online_Afisha_App.ipynb`](https://github.com/vrova3/data_analysis_practice_projects/blob/main/p5_business_analytics_LTV_CAC_ROI_for_Online_Afisha_App.ipynb)
**Description:** The data for this project includes 3 datasets: visits (359400 entries), orders (50415) and costs (2542). All of them are used to compare the sources of visits, calculate user conversion and retention, and analyse marketing expenses across channels.
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualisation, cohort analysis, business metrics.
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy Stats, MatPlotlib, SeaBorn.

### Making Business Decisions Based on Data: A/B Testing for an Online Store
**Code:** [`p6_business_decisions_based_on_data_AB_Testing_for_Online_Store.ipynb`](https://github.com/vrova3/data_analysis_practice_projects/blob/main/p6_business_decisions_based_on_data_AB_Testing_for_Online_Store.ipynb)
**Description:** Aside from the table containing the hypotheses, the data for this project comes from an orders dataset (just under 1200 entries) containing transactions for visitors from two experimental groups, and a small time-series table with total daily numbers of visits by groups over two months of the testing period.
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualisation, business metrics, defining KPIs, A/B testing, hypothesis prioritisation, statistical testing (Shapiro, Mann-Whitney, Levene).
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy Stats, MatPlotlib, SeaBorn.
